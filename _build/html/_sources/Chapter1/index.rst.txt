Chapter 1: Understanding Climate Science and Carbon Models
==========================================================

**Stocks and flows**

Pools exist in nature as the ocean, the earth's crust (Lithosphere), soils, atmosphere, etc. Pools are reservoirs or containers that store, accumulate or release substances; for example, a carbon pool stores and releases carbon. The total quantity of a substance in a pool at a particular time is called stock.

On the other hand, Flows change the stock in a pool and are measured in units per time.

The bathtub analogy is a perfect analogy used to describe these ideas. In a bathtub, we can understand the faucet and the drain can as flows, the bathtub holding the water as a pool, and finally, the amount of water accumulated in the bathtub as stock.


**States and Transition**

Simulation models help provide valuable insights into the dynamics of these landscapes. To run a simulation model, we must define the area or landscape we want to study at a particular time. This landscape is divided into small pixels to be simulated. 

A pixel can be classified by its state, which might change over time; for example, simple forest vegetation can have different states like Deciduous, Mixed, and Coniferous. Due to transitions, the forest vegetation can change to a different state over time.

State transitions can be due to fire, harvest, and succession disturbances. These transitions impact the stocks and flows of carbon pools.
